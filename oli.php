		<p>As the first and only boy of my parents 3 children, my dad felt he didn’t really have anyone else to force his geeky computer things onto, so I was ultimately the prime target. This quickly led onto my first PC build at 11. This is something I have continued to do throughout my life, I can now offer expert hardware advice for computers of any requirement!</p>
	    <br />
	    <p>A big part of my life consisted of taking things apart and seeing how they worked, for which my curiosity on how things worked dragged me further into development. I started out learning a little HTML at about 16, and started, trying, to build my own websites. Since then I have picked up several languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP and then pursued the ‘making things work’ side of things, learning languages like Python, Ruby and JavaScript.</p>
	    <br />
	    <p>I recently became the lead Web Developer for a marketing company called Fyber, who handle printing, marketing, web design, web development, and anything else you can really think of in online marketing and E-Commerce.</p>
	    <br />
	    <p>As I surpassed my dad’s knowledge on computers which, granted, wasn’t very hard, I became the new ‘Computer Whizz’ of the family, getting called upon for viruses, hardware issues, and anything else that could possibly break on a computer, increasing my knowledge further in debugging and building computers. I have taken this further into helping clients with their data protection concerns, removing viruses, and other hardware and software issues, and all customers I have dealt with have been fully satisfied with the support given.</p>
	    <br />
	    <p>Another huge part of my life is music. playing guitar since I was 6 and drums since I was around 10, as well as a few other instruments, I have developed not only a huge passion in computer and web developing, but also in the production and writing of music. Playing in several bands since I was 12, the most recent, and the longest standing of 3 years, Absent Parachute, playing in huge venues around Leeds, including The Cockpit, O<sub>2</sub> Academy Leeds, The Wardrobe, and plenty more.</p>
