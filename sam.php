		<h4>Sam</h4>
		<br />
		<p>I was born in the later years of the 90s in the historical city of York, and eventually moved to Leeds. Throughout my life I have had a strong interest in designing things, whether it be games, devices, or my own new (and admittedly poor) inventions. Throughout my childhood I had a strong interest in gaming, as most people my age did. I however took it upon myself to take up modding, and thus kick-started me on the journey I am on today. Since I learnt to code I picked up numerous languages as well as learnt numerous development packages.</p>
	    <br />
	    <p>Years later, with school and college out of the way and a bounty of languages under my belt, I became an apprentice web developer for Parallax. I have been very lucky to be able to work with the guys at Parallax, and they have not only given me a great opportunity, but also taught me things I couldn’t learn anywhere else.</p>
	    <br />
	    <p>As well as computing, I also have a strong love for all things music. If you ask me what sort of music I like you would get an answer which would translate to most people as only “unfathomable noise, with a bit of house too”. I have recently gotten involved in event organising, and am now in charge of Revival Promotions.</p>
	    <br />
	    <p>While I haven’t done it for a while, I do occasionally make mods for Skyrim, and have numerous reasonably-known YouTube content-creators who play Skyrim give me recognition for my work. My greatest project however was never released, after a long development stage left it too much of a task for something I was just doing for a bit of fun, however if anyone wants to try it out I’ll be sure to point you in the direction of my closed Alpha, which only a few developers and YouTubers were able to access.</p>
	    <br />
	    <p>As well as create websites and listening to questionable music, I also do graphics upon-request, as well as in my own time. I have done numerous posters for events as well as design professional flyers, logos, web pages, and even created some digital artwork using Photoshop. Feel free to enquire about any graphics work as I love to do it and would be more than happy to help you out!</p>
